There are two versions of Brighter. **Classic** only supports .NET
Framework and **Core** supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

Supporting .NET Core requires some changes to Brighter, mainly around
configuration or hosting approaches. As a result we have documentation
for both versions.

You should consider migrating your applications to the Core version as
the core maintainers will only support patching the Classic version with
bug fixes, not new features. Although the community may backport
features to the Classic version, we recommend moving to the Core version
as it supports multiple .NET platforms
